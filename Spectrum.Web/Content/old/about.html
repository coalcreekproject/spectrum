                        <h1>About Us</h1>
                        <h2>The Company</h2>
                        <p><p><strong>SpectrumEM</strong> is setting the new standard for Emergency Management Information System (EMIS) functionality, usability, and collaboration.  It was born out of a vision to provide full-spectrum Emergency Management software solutions that support all phases of Emergency Management – Planning, Preparation, Response and Recovery.  </p>
                        <p>
                            As the field is being revolutionized and professionalized, <strong>SpectrumEM</strong> will bring the latest in technology innovations to enable that transformation.  Being based in Boulder, Colorado we are literally at the center of the software start-up explosion and have the ability to identify, integrate and implement these innovations before they hit the market. Therefore, by partnering with usour customers will achievehigher performance leading to a clear return on investment and significantly improved outcomes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our software solutions comprise scalable, elastic and secure infrastructure on a flexible platform.  They are“cloud-native” or designed from the ground up to leverage the benefits of cloud technologydelivering superior speed and performance.  Other EMIS options typically rely on legacy systems, are adapted from applications designed for other disciplines or are hosted in-house requiring the infrastructure, network and support staff that many government and other organizations don’t have.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some providers may say they are cloud-based, but too often the applications are ported to the web after-the-fact and were not designed to fully leverage the power of the cloud.  This can cause the app to be slow and unresponsive, sometimes even worse than when in the data center, which is frustrating at best and dangerous at worst.  Cloud-native applications, such as <strong>SpectrumEM</strong> solutions, can be as much as 70% more efficient lowering your overall costs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another <strong>SpectrumEM</strong> differentiator is thatour team and systems and have a Process Orientation in order to ensure that the application isn’t static and only a repository for information, but rather, a tool to guide and support the business processes that you and your EM partners need to perform effectively and efficiently.  In combination with our expertise in Organizational Development, we can increase your team effectiveness and inter-agency collaboration so that you are ready to perform when needed the most.  Like a tennis player in the finals at Wimbledon, you and your teams have to be at your best when under the most pressure.
                        </p>
